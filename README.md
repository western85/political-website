# political-website


#### PoliticalWebsite is a tongue-in-cheek website promoting the support of a fake, but unscrupulous organization. The website showcases use of vanilla javascript, and design without the use of bootstrap. Feel free to use the signup to get a flash response and redirect. This is a simple website that I allowed myself to create from the ground up with total creative control and not does not necessarily reflect my own personal views.
